# NFT Mini Game 

## Play on -> https://nft-game-starter-project.shivashanmugana.repl.co/


### This is a simple NFT Based Mini Game that allows users to mint Valorant Heroes as an NFT, and use their NFT to fight against Thanos. The Battle changes the metadata on NFT.

It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
